Key Terminology

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: "Summary of terminology used in *devMSMs*"
terms = data.frame(
  Term  = c("**Exposure**", "**Outcome**","**Exposure Time Points**", "**Exposure Epochs**", "**Exposure Histories**", "**Exposure Dosage**", "**Confounder**", "**Time-varying confounder**", "**Time invariant confounder**", "**Collider**"),
  Definition = c(
  "Exposure or experience that constitutes the causal event of interest and is measured at at least two time points, with at least one time point occurring prior to the outcome.", 
  "Any developmental construct measured at least once at a final outcome time point upon which the exposure is theorized to have causal effects.", 
  "Time points in development when the exposure was measured, at which weights formulas will be created.", 
  "*(optional)* Further delineation of exposure time points into meaningful units of developmental time, each of which could encompass multiple exposure time points, that together constitute exposure main effects in the outcome model and exposure histories.", 
  "Sequences of relatively high (`'h'`) or low (`'l'`) levels of exposure at each exposure time point or exposure epoch.", 
  "Total cumulative exposure epochs/time points during which an individual experienced high (or low) levels of exposure, across an entire exposure history.", 
  "Pre-exposure variable that represents a common cause of exposure at a given time point and outcome; adjusting for all of which successfully blocks all backdoor paths.", 
  "A confounder that often changes over time (even if it is not measured at every time point), and is affected by prior exposure, either directly or indirectly.", 
  "A confounder that occurs only at a single time point, prior to the exposure and remains stable and/or is not possibly affected by exposure.", 
  "A variable that represents a common effect of exposure at a given time point and outcome; adjusting for which introduces bias.")

# Weights Formula

Weights formula are formula, or mathematical equations, created at each exposure time point, regressing exposure on confounders for the purpose of creating and/or assessing balancing weights. The general form is given by: <br>\

```{=html}
<pre><code>ESETA1.t ~ <span style='color: darkred'>time-invariant</span> confounders + <span style='color: blue'>time-varying</span> confounders + <i>lagged</i> <span style='color: seagreen;'>exposures</span> + <i>lagged</i> <span style='color: purple;'>outcomes</span></code></pre>
```

Below is a table that summarizes the three formula `type`s that will be used.
