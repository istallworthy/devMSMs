# devMSMs: Implementing Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) ![Structural Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istallworthy/devMSMs/main/inst/imgfile.png) with Longitudinal Data

Those who study and work with humans are fundamentally interested in
questions of causation. More specifically, scientists, clinicians,
educators, and policymakers alike are often interested in *causal
processes* involving questions about when (timing) and at what levels
(dose) different factors influence human functioning and development, in
order to inform our scientific understanding and improve people’s lives.
However, for many, conceptual, methodological, and practical barriers
have prevented the use of methods for causal inference developed in
other fields.  

The goal of this *devMSMs* package and accompanying tutorial paper,
*Investigating Causal Questions in Human Development Using Marginal
Structural Models: A Tutorial Introduction to the devMSMs Package in R*
([preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/284mb)), is to provide a
set of tools for implementing marginal structural models (**MSMs**;
Robins et al., 2000).

MSMs orginated in epidemiology and public health and represent one
under-utilized tool for improving causal inference with longitudinal
observational data, given certain assumptions. In brief, MSMs leverage
inverse-probability-of-treatment-weights (IPTW) and the potential
outcomes framework. MSMs first focus on the problem of confounding,
using IPTW to attenuate associations between measured confounders and an
exposure (e.g., experience, characteristic, event –from biology to the
broader environment) over time. A weighted model can then be fitted
relating a time-varying exposure and a future outcome. Finally, the
model-predicted effects of different exposure histories that vary in
dose and timing can be evaluated and compared as counterfactuals, to
reveal putative causal effects.  

We employ the term *exposure* (sometimes referred to as “treatment” in
other literatures) to encompass a variety of environmental factors,
individual characteristics, or experiences that constitute the putative
causal events within a causal model. Exposures may be distal or
proximal, reflecting a developing child’s experience within different
environments at many levels (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, 1994), ranging from
the family (e.g., parenting), home (e.g., economic strain), school
(e.g., teacher quality), neighborhood (e.g., diversity), to the greater
politico-cultural-economic context (e.g., inequality). Exposures could
also reflect factors internal to the child, including neurodevelopmental
(e.g., risk markers), physiological (e.g., stress), and behavioral
(e.g., anxiety) patterns to which the child’s development is exposed.  
  

## Core Features

Core features of *devMSMs* include:

- Flexible functions with built-in user guidance, drawing on established
  expertise and best practices for implementing longitudinal IPTW
  weighting and outcome modeling, to answer substantive causal questions
  about dose and timing

- Functions that accept complete or imputed data to accommodate
  missingness often found in human studies

- A novel recommended workflow, based on expertise from several
  disciplines, for using the *devMSMs* functions with longitudinal data
  (see *Workflows* vignettes)

- An accompanying simulated longitudinal dataset, based on the
  real-world, Family Life Project (FLP) study of human development, for
  getting to know the package functions

- An accompanying suite of [helper
  functions](https://github.com/istallworthy/devMSMsHelpers) to assist
  users in preparing and inspecting their data prior to the
  implementation of *devMSMs*

- Executable, step-by-step user guidance for implementing the *devMSMs*
  workflow and preliminary steps in the form of vignettes geared toward
  users of all levels of R programming experience, along with a [R
  markdown template
  file](https://github.com/istallworthy/devMSMs/blob/main/ExampleWorkflow.Rmd)

- A brief conceptual introduction, example empirical application, and
  additional resources in the accompanying tutorial paper

  

## Overview

The package contains 7 core functions for implementing the two phases of
the MSM process: longitudinal confounder adjustment and outcome modeling
of longitudinal data with time-varying exposures.

Below is a summary of the terms used in the *devMSMs* vignettes and
functions. More details and examples can be found in the accompanying
manuscript.  

| Term                          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Exposure**                  | Exposure or experience that constitutes the causal event of interest and is measured at at least two time points, with at least one time point occurring prior to the outcome.                                                                                 |
| **Outcome**                   | Any developmental construct measured at least once at a final outcome time point upon which the exposure is theorized to have causal effects.                                                                                                                  |
| **Exposure Time Points**      | Time points in development when the exposure was measured, at which weights formulas will be created.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Exposure Epochs**           | *(optional)* Further delineation of exposure time points into meaningful units of developmental time, each of which could encompass multiple exposure time points, that together constitute exposure main effects in the outcome model and exposure histories. |
| **Exposure Histories**        | Sequences of relatively high (`'h'`) or low (`'l'`) levels of exposure at each exposure time point or exposure epoch.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Exposure Dosage**           | Total cumulative exposure epochs/time points during which an individual experienced high (or low) levels of exposure, across an entire exposure history.                                                                                                       |
| **Confounder**                | Pre-exposure variable that represents a common cause of exposure at a given time point and outcome; adjusting for all of which successfully blocks all backdoor paths.                                                                                         |
| **Time-varying confounder**   | A confounder that often changes over time (even if it is not measured at every time point), and is affected by prior exposure, either directly or indirectly.                                                                                                  |
| **Time invariant confounder** | A confounder that occurs only at a single time point, prior to the exposure and remains stable and/or is not possibly affected by exposure.                                                                                                                    |
| **Collider**                  | A variable that represents a common effect of exposure at a given time point and outcome; adjusting for which introduces bias.                                                                                                                                 |

manuscript, We recommend first reviewing the
[Terminology](https://istallworthy.github.io/devMSMs/articles/Terminology.html)
and [Data
Requirements](https://istallworthy.github.io/devMSMs/articles/Data_Requirements.html)
vignettes as you begin preparing your data. We then recommend
downloading the [R markdown template
file](https://github.com/istallworthy/devMSMs/blob/main/ExampleWorkflow.Rmd)
which contains all the code described in the [Specify Core
Inputs](https://istallworthy.github.io/devMSMs/articles/Specify_Core_Inputs.html)
and *Workflows* vignettes (for binary (TBA) or
[continuous](https://istallworthy.github.io/devMSMs/articles/Workflow_Continuous_Exposure.html)
exposures) for implementing the steps below.
